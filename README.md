# Magical-Progression
# For the magical progression Modpack 
# Notes/Agreements:
# Please do not copy the code (zen script, Config, custom files, etc.) directly into your own packs.
# Feel free to use It as inspiration, or for help to learn. I worked very hard on it and I dont want my content taken verbatim.
# Also, if you want to use the art, please ask me first. I will most likely say ok, but if you use it without permission I will always say no.
# If you are a bitch, and I deem you a bitch, Then I hold the right to refuse you to use my custom content for your own uses (packs, mods, other games, etc). I dont deem many people bitches, so dont worry unless you're racist or something.
# Playing, copying the files, or intentionally mimicking the pack means you agree to the conditions listed above. 
# https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/magical-progression The pack is available here. 



# Policy, but not hard rules:
# While I wont stop you, Please don't clone or play preupdate files. It may be unstable, or spoil features for you. Please Don't record or post pictures of pre-update content if you do play. 
# If you have new recipes you think I should add, please make a new zenscript file and submit as an issue rather than attempting to commit it yourself as a tweak of the main file. 
# Also, pet your cat if you have one before playing.




# If you have questions about the pack, submit as an issue, DM on reddit or curseforge, or comment.
# If you encountered a crash, submit an issue with the vanilla fix log linked, as well as a discription of what you did prior to the crash.
# If you found a loophole, or a oversight that allows for cheesing, submit as an issue, or DM on curseforge.
